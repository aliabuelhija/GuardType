Actually, the first thing that ought to be done to unbias the article and make it encyclopaedic is to have the name of the article reflecting his formal name. This should be not a campaign advertisement which it currently is. That goes for any politician that is listed in an encyclopaedia by their """"buddy name"""".

All Trayvon had to do is call the cops if he was soooo scared. 

The cops did NOT tell Zimmerman NOT to follow him. There's a HUGE diff btw a 911 operator and a cop. Telling someone 'we don't need you to do that' is NOT the same as a direct order and finally, Zimmmerman claims he DID stop following at that point.

If EIGHT BLACK TEENS were CAUGHT robbing people in that neighborhood, not to mention the ones that didn't get caught, then you'd have to be an IDIOT to not eyeball someone acting as suspiciously as Trayvon. For all we know, he could have robbed someone in the sub in one of his visits. We know the cops said he had a jewel-thieving tool. 

Oh that's right, the cops are not to be trusted. Except when they tell you 'We don't need you to do that.' Then you MUST obey! lol

I knew there was something wrong with those assholes when i saw them the first time. Guess I'll have to abandon this account. Hey  you still need to learn how to read links! Don't think I forgot! This isn't funny asshole! Guess what? I have been using another account and you don't even know what it is since the very first time I was blocked! Ha, keep playing your games, you aren't preventing me from editing piece of shit. Oh and  don't think I forgot about your 5 year old temper issues when anyone tries and fixes issues with your precious Dreamcast punk ass bitch. Lol, you guys did a number on this account. Probably found out what program I was using for the first BS account you made. 

I am impressed with how much damage you have done to this account, but it really means nothing when I am still editing every day on my personal internet and you have no idea which account it is. Oh and no it's not using a proxy or a public wifi spot. Heck, I may even try reporting this, all you idiots did was use proxy's, if I post on this account on my personal connection, and THEN appeal this I might just get my account back and get you idiots banned. I know exactly what you are going to do after this to wait until I log off, and then pounce with a new account. Sadly, looking at all this crap in my talk page, an admin would have to be retarded to not see how many of these """"accounts"""" that are proxies and not actual connections. You can only hide the smell of rotten fish for awhile before someone notices.

Shit, may was well clean this shit up. 

Oh wait a second one more thing, , what kind of retarded admin are you when having a bunch of almost all accounts pretending to be me are all on proxies and not ONE of them acts like me (did you even see my history?), and not one uses a real connection? Got that brain damage you do. had to put that in bold to be clear. Warning me about an indefinite block, lol, what does that matter, you already screwed up noticing what a 5 year old would have noticed by now. Any person would be frustrated by the silliness of this nonsense. I would appeal but something tells me to much shit damage and retarded admins will make this impossible, and I would rather not use the IP of my other account (using a real connection n my personal internet) because then you guys will probably be jackass and deleted for fun, look at this page! All this shit and nothing clicked in your small head? Amazing wikipedia. 

Also I need to take note to stay away from low ranked video game pages and focus on popular until you guys get tired of the act.

Also I KNOW you guys got an account that is going to post a bit after I submit this post I SAW him and he did the EXACT same thing 3 of the duded did, you guys need help, I can't believe not one guy was not like """"this shit don't make sense"""" for a whole second. Amazing.

Alright, so clean this page and leave this message here. Erase other extra crap. Alright, looks like we are in business. BTW, I know this is probably bull, but if any of you two actually are not trolling, which is highly unlikely, than post request an admin to come by so I can clear this account up. But I have this sinking feeling you guys all knew what's been going on here this whole time, and I have no patience to search through tons of pages to find ONE contact I can talk to about this block, so you might have this account, but you won't get the other one. Suck doesn't it? Until then, I will be going about my day and you guys will most likely probably still be doing this for X amount of days cause I guess you think it's funny? Yeah.

 Hypocrisy 

I'm sick of this clique mentality. Rodhullandemu told me my proposed contribution to an article was worth """"fuck all"""".

My contribution which, apparently, was worth """"fuck all"""" and was """"piss poor"""" is currently featured in the article.

Doubtless these inconvenient facts will do little to change your mind regarding my block. But at least show a little consistency with regards to personal attacks and use of profanities. The truth is, Rodhullandemu began all this anomosity between him and I and it all goes back to this.

Your relationship with your spouse may improve if you would just listen to him/her and get away from your total control of other people. It isn't helping that huge inferiority complex. The blokes that kicked you around years ago don't count anymore. Take it or leave it. I am bigger than you. Again suck it up and on your bike. 216.191.214.90",1
"Nay, you ARE homophobic and indeed very much so. I have been seeing your ilk for the 40 years of my life: those who pretend to be objective only to push a one-sided oppressive, offensive POV. 

 Moreover, judging by the way you edit to make them appear in the best of lights, you seem to be in the employ of the horrible individual about whom that article is.

 Eventually, if you cannot read English, then your competence in language is obviously quite limited, which is not something I should be concerned about, so kindly abstain from including such off-side nonsense into the discussion.",1

i am an op1 (rank 99.9) dental student from australia, in uni at the age of 16, and despite that i can still manage to not be anywhere near as much of a tightass as you show yourself to be.

Seriously, do you think you are better than the people that give you shit about your attitude to wikipedia? It is so pathetic that you have to grab at power in this nonexistent world just because you have no influence on anything meaningful in the outside world.

I think the inferences I make about your real world life are more than fair. Do you actually have a life? No, a level 70 shadow preist on wow does not count, nor does having a password for private irc channels and torrent referrers. Like, where is your girlfriend? Perhaps, if you continue to piss off everyone you come into contact with (i make reference to the discussion of the neutrality of the anglican church grammar school page), someone may just take the time out to slap you the fuck awake and make you step back and see how pathetic what you are doing really is.

You make me sick....fuckkkkk you are a vegetarian, i hadn't noticed your username for what it was until now, and you continue to reinforce every idea i ever formed about who you may be.

seeing as it is now 1:20am AEST and i have shit to do 2morro i really cant be bothered reading any of what i have just written, because you are clearly so deeply entrenched in your own pathetic way of being and have trained your mind to ignore everything anyone else says to you that you do not like by getting 'you're a gay pedo' (and similar) emails.

if i had smoked myself stupid and that was the deepest level i could insult you on, i would send fuck you emails to you all day long. i can take time out of my day, as much as i have better things to do, to give you shit because you are a pathetic, insecure, power hungry piece of shit, weilding you wikipedia administrator status like a trident against everyone that hates you, when really you more than likely were dropped as a child/feel unloved/were bullied in school/have a small dick and feel you have to be a complete social recluse and hide behind a screen.

i hope you do write back. please do. oh my, please write back. i would love to listen to your self-reichous shit, thinking you can make 'quirky' little quips and rhetorts to distance yourself from what people say about you, and feel you have re-established yourself as superior.

im guessing you are probably online doing pointless shit right now, and so i am keen to receive my reply soon.

"""
Hello again, Tdadamemd. Getting right to your comment about slang, I don't understand your stating that """"fuck"""" is not slang, or your linking to dictionary.com as proof that it is not. The word """"fuck,"""" while vulgar, is also slang; the dictionary.com source you cited even states so. It makes it clear that it can be slang for a variety of things, including sexual intercourse/other sexual activity. It list 13 numbered examples regarding what """"fuck"""" can mean. As for Wiktionary, I don't refer to sources like that. And, yes, I am fine with mentioning """"fuck"""" (or """"fucking"""") and the euphemism """"sleeping together"""" lower in the article, in the the Definitions and stimulation factors section, as alternative words for sexual intercourse/sexual activity. But again, there are a lot of terms for sexual intercourse, most of them slang. That these terms exist doesn't mean that all of them should be in this article. In fact, most times when there are many alternative terms for a word, especially if those terms are slang, we don't include all of them. As you know, this is an encyclopedia and not a dictionary. 

If WP:CONSENSUS is achieved for including your proposal, I'll add it by briefly summarizing that there are various vulgar and/or slang terms and euphemisms for sexual intercourse/other sexual activity...such as """"fuck"""" and """"sleeping together"""" (the wording won't be exactly like that, of course). And, really, because there are so many terms for sexual intercourse, and """"fuck"""" is not especially relevant to the topic of sexual intercourse (by that, I mean that most people and sources are not discussing the word """"fuck"""" when discussing sexual intercourse), that is probably why """"fuck"""" isn't currently in this article. Someone who is aware of your having repeatedly added it to the lead expressed to me via email me that """"fuck"""" is also U.S.-centric; so that's also something to think about, though the term is also used outside of the United States. 

Also, sexual intercourse does not = fuck. It's that fuck = sexual intercourse; in its literal sense anyway, since when people use the term...they are usually using it as profanity. That is also why I told you """"The Fuck article mentions sexual intercourse in its lead because it is especially relevant to the topic. However, the term 'fuck' is not especially relevant to the topic of sexual intercourse."""" 

I cannot see how this article is broken simply because it doesn't currently include """"fuck."""" But, like I stated, I don't mind adding it to the article. I'd rather see what others have to state on that matter first, however.   """,1

I have provided some citations in Rajus page which are taken from famous hostorical books from famous historians.
There are more historical books which give more mistory and glory about this Kshatriya Raju caste, but due to time constraint I am not able to pick them all. 
It is unfortunate that Mr Sitush is removing citations from historical persons, and citing some odd quotations from infamous/ left out historical books. Mr Sitush has removed citation from  The History of Andhra Country, Yashoda Devi. Yashoda Devi is a famous historian. Please check about Historian Yashoda Devi and her book.

Its seems there is some allergy for Mr Sitush in accepting Rajus as Kshatriyas which is making him to remove valuable historical content on Rajus page. Please cross check the WP you would come to know.

 Watermarks 

I shall remove the obvious ones, the less obvious ones stay. I am allowed to watermark images with anything whatsoever I wish to, even if it's a contradiction, and if you wish me to use up further WP  bandwidth by re-uploading them, that has no effect on me. I can't do anything until this evening, and if any get deleted, I shall reupload them. Yours without respect (talk|email) 
You could have the grace to reply. I said that I'd deal with them this evening, but only the ones where the watermark is visible from the page. So *** off (talk|email) 
I am planning to re-upload them with less obtrusive watermarks, such as that on Image:Bliss parody.jpg. (talk|email) 
It wasn't vandalism; I used an external link as per your instructions, which incidentally I'm not bound to follow. I am certainly on the verge of requesting mediation, as you are disrupting my life, never mind WP, to make a point. I will tell you one more time: any images are better than none. If you wish to get your own pix of all the concerned images, you're damn welcome to try, but they are GFDL therefore there's no grounds for removal. (talk|email) 
PS - I shall add the external link again, not as an image, and if you remove it I shall make a formal complaint to the Wikimedia Foundation, and the Information Commissioner in London. (talk|email) 

, your conduct is a little off in this matter. While I'm all for discussing the issues with users, let's keep it civil please? Thanks.  (talk) 

 I disagree, Rob - it is far more than """"a little"""" off. Images watermarked as such are not in any way appropriate for Wikipedia. This is an encyclopædia, not a pet image project. If """"TheDoctor10"""" isn't happy to play ball, he can go elsewhere.

I edit from the United Kingdom, and under the 1990 Computer Misuse Act, the editing of information online is illegal, without permission. The button at the top of every page that says """"Edit this page"""", among other things, constitutes that permission, while the policies and guidelines form conditions. Since there is no condition against my image, it has a legal right to be there. Q.E.D. (talk|email) 
True, but therefore your addition fails under the same logic. Also, Wikimedia own the servers, it's their right to delete it. 13ID:540053 
Apologies to Ed for invading his talk page, but what a load of rubbish! Wikipedia are under no legal obligation whatsoever to host your images, regardless of whether they meet any policy. I have no idea under what flawed logic you presume that the fact you can edit Wikipedia means that your edits must legally be accepted. If the Computer Misuse Act states that the editing of information online is illegal without permission, that implies that editing with permission is legal, and nothing more. Furthermore, by your logic, I have the legal right to edit Wikipedia, and remove your images...

The Executive Branch had a schedule of when it had to file factual returns in the Uyghurs' habeas cases.  The Uyghur's factual returns were due in October.  In those factual returns they would have been obliged to lay out valid evidence to justify the Uyghur's detention.  It is important to quote our sources accurately.

The DoJ simply said that they were changing their plans, and would not put forward arguments that the Uyghurs were """"enemy combatants"""".  Some commentators went on record as interpreting this change of plans not as an acknowledgment that the Uyghurs weren't enemies, but merely as a strategic decision that the value of establishing that the Uyghurs were enemy combatants was insufficient to justify making classified sources public.

Personally, I agree, that the Uyghurs were wrongfully imprisoned.  But I understand that personal opinions like that don't belong in article space.  The wikipedia is not supposed to be used for advocacy.  We shouldn't rewrite history to improperly imply the Uyghur's """"innocence"""" has been an established fact.
As I have explained to you before, if you find Urbina's ruling, and he used that phrase, you can include the phrase in the article  properly attributed to Urbina.
If an WP:RS, like a newspaper or legal magazine quotes Urbina's ruling, and he used that phrase, you can include the phrase in the article  properly attributed to Urbina.
If an WP:RS, like a newspaper or legal magazine, in summarizing Urbina's ruling, uses that phrase, you can include the phrase in the article  attributed to the WP:RS, not to Urbina.
If you find Urbina's ruling, and he used a different phrase, like, """"...the USA has no legal justification to hold Razakah..."""", you are stuck using that phrase, even if other judges used the phrase """"wrongfully imprisoned"""" in other habeas rulings.

WRT where to find the DoJ's appeal...  A reference to the CCR's Guantanamo habeas scorecard was offered right in the paragraph where I added that the ruling in his habeas was appealed.  The CCR's Guantanamo habeas scorecard has a column for whether a habeas ruling was appealed.  That column in Razakah's entry says his ruling was appealed.  I urge you to double check references more carefully before claiming assertions were unreferenced.

WRT his """"innocence"""", you assert above: """"There is hardly anybody now who doubt this...""""  this is an argument based on common knowledge.  Further, your draft asserted that their innocence was established """"early"""".  We don't base our articles on common knowledge, or our personal opinions as to what is common knowledge, we base them on what we can verify from authoritative reliable sources.    """,0

 Perspective? 
""""In the trial Shylock represents the Jewish side in contrast to the Christian one in a matter of highest importance: Justice (Jewish, Old Testament) is confronted with Mercy (Christian, New Testament). In the Christian view mercy is the decisive step after justice is reached. Therefore the Christians in the courtroom urge mercy. Beside the fact, that Shylock as a Jew is not in duty to give mercy, he is not able as well, because for this you need love. He doesn't find love at all, but hate. Shakespeare explains this in Shylock's monologue very clearly. To be merciful despite the hate nevertheless you have to love your enemy (New Testament). That means in fact that the Christians in the courtroom urge Shylock to behave like a very true Christian by loving his enemies although they themselves failed even in loving just their neighbours (the Jews) in the past before.""""

 removed. Nor do I know why the Inkball game is supposedly removed. This section cites no references and these
 claims are the most questionable.  

I'm not sure as the the reasons as to why they we're removed but I can tell you that Ink Ball is not found anywhere in the beta release, I'm not sure about the classic start menu and taskbar, i don't see an option for them but I didn't look all that hard   

 Inkball only appears in Tablet Edition windows products.  Is there a tablet addition of the Windows 7 beta?   
 Hmm... I may be wrong there.  The article mentions that it also appeared in Vista Home Edition.  Still, Can't imagine it's very fun with a mouse.   
It does indeed come with Vista Home Premium, not sure about other editions.   
It also comes with Ultimate. But anyway, mentioning it has been removed if the only evidence we have is it's not included in the current beta is an incredibly bad idea. We need a reliable source saying Microsoft has decided to remove it. There could be plenty of reasons why it's not in beta, only one of them is Microsoft has decided to remove it completely

 POV Tag Vandalism? 

David Starr has re-posted the POV alert tag on this page. I do not feel he ever fully addressed my questions. He is asserting that the page shows overwhelming bias in some way - according to him there are only two specific single line instances that he cites of bias on the page, both in the bio. This does not a biased page make.

I have clearly refuted both of these claims at length, with no response (despite repeated requests) from Starr. 

1) The """"garbage"""" passage is balanced with an explanation from a Da spokesperson. The source is quoted, phrase is neutral, and source (scholar Georg Feuerstein) is not in dispute by Starr. The mention is crucial because it explains the """"controversial"""" aspect in first line of lead, and period is alluded to in Adidam apologies for """"controversial"""" earlier behavior and in the numbers of lawsuits, news articles, and analysis by authorities linked to and discussed in Da page. Also, further explained by Da himself in """"Crazy Wisdom"""" section in teaching.

2) Mention of 1986 breakdown/Divine Emergence. This is a significant event, as attested by Adi Da press. Source is not biased, all mentions of events are phrased neutrally within basic journalistic standards. Balanced with Adi Da self-assessment as personally significant event (about which an entire book was written.)

3)""""Undue weight"""" was shown to be unreasonable, as each line is short without subjective exposition. On balance throughout page, all potentially """"controversial"""" material (in every case sourced, cited, and neutrally phrased) is far outweighed by neutral info and Da """"self-assessment."""" 

Every potentially controversial mention is carefully contextualized and phrased to reflect source, and balanced with an alternate explanation. In every case. 

Source disputes:
1) Gurdjieff Journal: no specific instances of bias are alleged by Starr from this source. Starr is simply questioning the source without saying why it is an issue. Did not address my point that source is only used because it summarizes bio info from Da, Rudi, and Siddha Yoga accounts. No bias is reflected in WP entry, no has any been revealed. And Starr has failed to show how magazine is biased or """"self-published"""" simply making assertion that it is a """"competing religious organization"""" which is simply unproven (there is no Gurdjieff church or """"organization"""").

2) Lake County News: source has been used for other articles, Starr only questions it for single mention that he subjectively finds to his dislike (the Divine Emergence passage). He has not worked to find alternative source that would allow the material about a significant event to remain. Source has been found acceptable to all other editors in past months, as demonstrated by its repeated use. Starr cannot singly enter now and discount source, when not showing WP guideline that effectively discounts it (only his own subjective analysis of the quality of the """"contact"""" page on their website.)

All other editors, including myself, have been involved in give an take on this page, making allowances and corrections for each other - even yesterday I made changes to accommodate other editors, including Starr. I do not feel that Starr is meeting this standard, and in particular completely failed to address my repeated specific requests. Because of this, I am removing the POV tag as vandalism and an attempt to discount page. I have requested third party review, and perhaps further dispute resolution.   """,0

Try as I might, I'm not really able to associate your Zebra analogy with this article. For it to work, this would have to be an article about the colour white, and even then it doesn't really work. The purpose of my change is to remove the """"comparison"""" nature of the section. It's not meant to be a comparison to begin with. The problem right now is that the section really violates NPOV - it places weight on a comparison with another format, rather than standing by itself. The fact it mentions Blu-ray means we have a somewhat unnecessary argument going on in the Talk: pages about a graph which is exclusively focussed on comparing Blu-ray and HD DVD studio support. 

To be NPOV, this part of the article needs to focus on what support HD DVD has. Issues such as what proportion of the studios support it are obviously relevant. Issues as to whether they support either of the competing formats (incumbent DVD, as well as Blu-ray) aren't really, except insofar as it should be mentioned that the rivaly exists.

We need to move the fanboi """"HD DVD is better"""", """"No, Blu-ray is better!"""", """"Well, HD DVD has more support!"""", """"No, Blu-ray has more support!"""" crap to the comparison articles.   18:13, 21""",0

-Chess forces personal views, not supported by science

Wikipedia user -Chess participates in vandalism the following way:

Over and over again the Wikipedia user -Chess has been asked on this discussion page to present a known historian or another acceptable source, quote or reference to back up his claims, for instance about his """"16th century"""" Finnish migration theory to Northern Norway, etc.

-Chess has refused to respond to any of these pleas for sources.  Now, that Mr. Chess has changed the Kven text to reflect his personal theories - which are not supported by science - he is attempting to lock and protect the site from reverts and/or further edits.

The Wikipedia user -Chess is forcing his personal views into the Wikipedia Kven text.  Those views are not supported by science.  Not willing to present any sources for the peaces of information inserted by him, the Wikipedia user -Chess is participating in vandalism.

Let it be known, that most parts of the Wikipedia Kven text remaining as of today, which were left standing from earlier contributors, seem accurate.  However, Mr. Chess has attempted to include into the text some of his own ideas, which do not seem to match the opinions of any known historians.  

If Fred Chess disagrees, we once again ask him to provide sources for his claims - even just one source, which could be considered distinguished and reliable.

In his earlier discussion comment above, Fred Chess praises and thanks a respond from user .  However, even that commentator sides against Fred Chess, who - without any scientific foundation, or without any sources presented - tries to present the Northern Norwegian Kvens as a separate and totally non-connected group from the medieval Kvens of Northern Scandinavia.

Wikipedia user  correctly states:  """"Of course, the present Kvens in Northern Norway have a connection with the Finnish-speaking medieval settlers in Northern Sweden and Finland.""""

, March 22, 2006

Vandalism by 

Below are three misquotations by user , from his unsigned message above (his previously used IP address 130.234.75.167 shows that the message is his): 

Claim Number One: """"Tavastians (a group of Southern Finns) were present on the Arctic Ocean alreydy during the Viking Age"""".

Claim Number Two: """"Some believe that the Kvens were the original inhabitants of Northern Norway"""".

Claim Number Three: """" According to Ottar, the Kvens were living in Northern Norway and around the White Sea"""".

When you choose to quote someone, please use the copy and paste technique.  No one has said any of the three sentences above.  You simply changed the wording, to make up goofy sounding sentences, which you claim some one actually wrote.  

Please, explain:  When and where were those sentences written ?  You are simply participating in vandalism, aren't you.  

You've also changed the content of a comment written by another Wikipedia user to this discussion page (and we do not mean you placing your responses between the lines, although for that too you ought to ask a permission from the writer of the comment).

At 13:45, 19 March 2006, using the IP address 130.234.5.136 you added the following sentence to the text which another Wikipedia user had written under the headline Lack of public funding a major cause for lack of information:

""""It's not going to happen, however.""""  You did not return to fix that act of vandalism which you published as a page http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Kven&oldid;=44501610.

You did not write that sentence in italic text, nor did you margin that sentence with your text, as you did all your other parts of your comments.  Purposely or not, you made it appear as if the other party would have written that comment.  

From here on - to avoid further such temptations and/or accidents - please refrain from placing your comments in between the lines written by other participants on this discussion forum.

Also """"so only nanites and nanotechnologies are widely in use"""" is a non sequitur - it's not a logical conclusion that """"only nanites"""" and nanotechnologies are widely in use because biotech is limited. Furthermore what's the """"only"""" referring to? Only in which area of life - medical? social? every?! Also I don't think it's not impossible for biotech to coexist in nanotech even though it probably (and eventually that might be a core characteristic) plays a subordinate role.
So I basically think everything about that sentence is false. I might be wrong about it (parts of it). So please post whatever you think of that here.
If there are no objections I'm gonna delete that sentence and somehow get the """"in nanopunk biotech plays a subordinate role to nanotechnology""""-part in there (which isn't really what the quoted sentence conveys).   """,0

Looking at the editing Histories of Goethena/Propol
For the interested parties that are watching this talk page and article, it would 
be useful to look at the nature and tone of edits which  and 
 have done in the last few weeks and judge the loving kindness they
impart on the Duckworth article, vers the near libelous editing on the Roskam article.

This just pointing out """"facts"""" and not in volition of WP:AGF in quoting that policy it says...

This policy does not require that editors continue to assume good faith in the presence of evidence to the contrary. Actions inconsistent with good faith include vandalism, sockpuppetry, and lying. Assuming good faith also does not mean that no action by editors should be criticized, but instead that criticism should not be attributed to malice unless there is specific evidence of malice. Accusing the other side in a conflict of not assuming good faith, without showing reasonable supporting evidence, is another form of failing to assume good faith.

So, any honest hearted admin, in light of the John Seigenthaler, Sr Debacle, will not
surely not allow the kind of bias editing that now taking place.  So, in the mean time, and until there is some ruling tendered from higher athority, I will lovingly protect the Roskam article as   and  lovingly protect the Duckworth article from any, and all negative edits, even edits that are well cited, per wikipedia policy, I will do the same for the Roskam article.  

Again, I am willing for dialog with other editors regarding good faith edits, but the two editors which I have mentioned above, due again, to their well documented editing histories on the Duckworth and Roskam, I will revert most of what they put up unless those edits conform, IMHO, to Wikipolicy to WP:BLP  WP:NPOV  WP:NPOV#Undue weight.  and finely  WP:SENSE.

Find any other equivalent. You guys have changed the entire subject. The fact of the matter is that you can not call ethnic groups prior to 1919 as Azerbaijani; there was no such defined identity. Why are there articles on the Dutchy? The Dutchy were more defined as a group than were the Turkic peoples living in those lands… why not plain German? And again, Parishan is using Russian and Soviet propaganda material, which maintained such a position, including for the Turks living in Armenia, to stop Turkey's expansionism… they had Turks in Nakhichevan and those in Armenia rather to adhere to an Azerbaijani identity than Turkish. But prior to the Soviet rules, those people were not identifying themselves, neither were they identified as such. I am wondering how much more can Parishan provide other than Soviet-Russian historiography which was known to be tainted when covering ethnic groups and ethno genesis, turning ethnic groups into groups that all originated from the identities forming the Union, some sort of Self-Sufficient system. This process already started during the end of the Russian Empire, Roy writes: In Azerbaijan for a brief period (the governorate of Vorontsov in the 1850s, and that of Goltsyn from 1896 to 1905), the Russians encouraged the development of an Azeri identity in order to weaken links with Iran and Turkey (The New Central Asia The Creation of Nations by Olivier Roy I.B.Tauris, (2000) p.56)

During the process, many different groups were pushed into being identified as ethnically Azerbaijani, including Kurds, who haven't until recently when groups wanted their independence requested their identity to be changed: In 1988 some 10,000 Kurds in Azerbaijan returned their Azeri identity papers to Moscow with the explicit request that their identity be changed from Azeri to Kurd. (A Modern History of the Kurds by David McDowall, I.B.Tauris (2004), p.493)

And to use Parishan’s opening, it is funny how Parishan is requesting sources for those quotes, Ulvi were you not a participant on the arbitration enforcement? How many sources were used? Parishan has probably missed references like this: In 1897 'Tatars'-which officially included most Muslim groups... (Socialism in Georgian Colors: The European Road to Social Democracy, 1883-1917, Harvard University Press (2005) p. 19)

Here, another quote missed by Parishan: In Contrast with the Armenians, the Azerbaijani national identity is very recent. In fact, the very name """"Azerbaijani"""" was not widely used until the 1930s; before that, Azerbaijani intellectuals were unsure whether they should call themselves Caucasian Turks, Muslims, Tatars or something else.  (S.Kaufmann, Modern hatred, Cornell University Press, 2001. See page 56.) 

Do I need to provide what was provided and include also newer ones? I like Eupator’s request RFC about this article, and a it’s a good idea of requesting the same for several other articles. Ulvi, your English language justification makes no sense; you could have changed for Turkic people instead of making an inaccurate move. -   """,0

This is my last reply if you continue to present yourself in this manner.  Please write more civilly.

I expect people to go to Oyster Bay just as I expect them to go to Barre, Vermont.  When you type that, do you expect a disambiguation page or do you except the city?  Admittedly, it's not the most convenient, but that's the way it is in all eight """"town"""" states.  Are you going to try to change every single community with this sort of disambiguation?  If so, go ahead — but unless you so desire, don't try to have one or two changed.  You speak of errors that result (for example, the Oyster Bay disambiguation page) — I do my best to fix wrong links as a result of changes such as this, but I don't see why I must be held responsible for every single wrong link.  If you never make mistakes, that's good; but I suspect that you so do.  So what?  It doesn't matter if you make a good-faith error, especially if you try to fix it once you realise that something's wrong.

By the way, if you put """"Oyster Bay, New York"""" into the Census Bureau's Factfinder, you'll get this page: it's the town.  Barre, Vermont is similar to what we'd call a disambiguation page; the city is listed as Barre city, Vermont.  This, I expect, is the reason that these articles are named this way: the Census is our source for the names and the basic information, and therefore we entitle our articles likewise by this reliable source.

Not a big deal, except of course you can tell the ‘anti-Japanese’ wikipedia sites here because they do not mention Japan as a member of the ‘Allies’ despite it being and undisputed historical fact by English and Japanese historians. how I see it used in Asian history books""""

WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? Italy did change sides in WWII and a co-belligerent state supporting the allies established but the RSI was also set up a state in the North, however Japan was NEVER part of the allies in World War II! As for JAPANESE historians and history books – haven’t you heard about Japanese history textbook controversies .  

In WWI, Brazil declared war on Germany in 1917, however there was never any formal alliance signed between Brazil and the Entente, the Triple entente wasn’t even a formal alliance, but an agreement – there was a unity agreement, however that stated that they would not seek a separate peace with Germany. Britain only declared war on Germany after it invaded Belgium and the United States declared war on Germany and Austria Hungary in 1917 yet not on Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire. They are called allies because they were ‘’united for a common purpose’’ - the defeat of Germany and or of the Central Powers as a whole, American industrial strength in terms of munitions and armaments also bolstered the British, French and other allies.   
In WWII, the ALLIES were overall fighting a common enemy at one point in time, and had a common purpose. SOME countries declared war yet did not send personnel to fight but assisted in the the allies in economic or other forms(severing relations etc.).       

Allies amd Axis
The Allies were those countries that joined together in an association against Germany then later Italy and Japan and those countries/movements associated with them(the Axis). In the beginning – Britain and it’s Commonwealth/Empire, France etc. and later countries that joined them against these powers including the US and Soviet Union and exiled governments. There were tensions between the powers especially Roosevelt - De Gaulle and Churchill/Roosevelt – Stalin, however there was mutual co-operation in the form of lend lease and other agreements. On January 1 1942 all of the belligerents signed a document called the Declaration by United Nations - the parties pledged to uphold the Atlantic Charter, to employ all their resources in the war against the Axis powers, and that none of the signatory nations would seek to negotiate a separate peace with Germany/Japan and the other member of the Axis.
Not all of the countries delcared war on all of the members of the Axis immediately or some not at all – eg.Brazil only declaring war on Japan on 6/61945. Some countries like only declared war on Japan because they entered to late in the war like Chile, other countries like the Norway and Poland declared war on Japan yet they did not contribute forces against Japan. 

A Global War
""""All I am saying is that if we want to portray that period of history accurately, that in the same way we do not include the Finnish Winter War nor the ongoing Chinese Civil War as part of what we call ww2, that we should record there being 2 separate wars: one in the ‘West’(Europe, Mediterranean) and one in the ‘East’(Pacific and East Asia), and therefore 2 separate groups of friends and foes, 2 separate formations of ‘Allies’. Then we also appear more moral historically.""""

""""What I am saying was that the war in Europe and the war in Asia were 2 separate wars. 2 separate groups of alliances. 2 separate military alliances we deliberately, or just simply irresponsibly, confuse by using the same title ‘Allies’ or ‘Grand Alliances’. Once we admit they were 2 separate wars, then it all makes more sense and make us look all the more moral.""""

""""So even today, we use the same title of an alliance to refer to 2 different wars at the very same time, in this case, right next to eachother even. But if you tell a Canadian, German or Hollander etc that they are members of the same ‘coalition’ at war in Iraq, they will take great offense at your ignorance.""""

While the """"circle notation"""" for benzene is popular in high school teaching, I have never seen a higher-level organic chemistry textbook that uses it, or met a practicing chemist who uses it. The """"Kekule notation"""" seems to be much more popular among chemists. It is overwhelmingly used in all the major chemistry journals I know, whether published by the ACS, the RCS, Elsevier, or Wiley. In my opinion, the reason is that once you go beyond benzene and start to look at heterocycles, polycyclic aromatic molecules, reactive intermediates, and reaction mechanisms, the Kekule notation makes electron counting and """"electron pushing"""" much more straightforward. The circle notation only seems to be common for some organometallic compounds such as ferrocene and some aromatic ions such as the cyclopentadienyl anion and the tropylium cation.   """,0

It's not simply one perspective of that same person, it's a different belief and the entire reason why the articles is here in the first place. It isn't simply a fact that because a figure exists in two religions that we can not have the real name of the figure being used as the name.

"""Revisiting neutrality on the Clinton entry==
I edited some content about the Richard Mellon Scape adversarial relationship with Clinton that dogged his career for 8 years and even after he left office. Many of the controversies raised during Clinton's term were a DIRECT result of the Scape Arkansas Project and to see any reference to Richard Mellon Scape's part in Clinton's troubles just """"disappear"""" seems like a very """"right-wing-view"""" sanitization of the Wikipedia. 
As the, arguably, most important adversary of Clinton for a lengthy portion of Clinton's political career, to obliterate any mention of this relationship comes close to censorship.
R.M. Scape is one of two very large and looming forces at work in American politics in the early 21st century, the other being George Soros on the left. Their fingerprints, from behind the curtain, certainly draw analogies to the Wizard(s) of Oz.
Please note that I did not vote for Clinton either time, being somewhat more conservative, but I have noticed an apparent right shifted bias developing in areas that touch upon politically related items in the Wikipedia lately - and """"it ain't good"""" as they say. 

This slow erosion of complete disclosure concerning what is stylized as """"right wing leaning"""" viewpoints and the retention of those things which critisize """"left wing leaning"""" viewpoints is subtle but steady - not just here, but across many places on the Wikipedia. While they make me smile sometimes, my inclination toward keeping Wikipedia neutral reins in my mirth.

I would encourage the group to rethink the neutrality of Wikipedia & work very hard to balance the influences on both sides to prevent any more of this """"shading"""" of the Wikipedia.

I know it is very hard to remain absolutely objective but it is imperative that we do so in order to remain a respected source. To remain COMPLETELY factual without opinionated bias, it seems to me Wikipedia should error on the side of INclusion rather than EXclusion.

 Coming to an understanding 

I've done most of the lion's share of edits on this article, but I want to make it clear that my interest is in having a neutral article, and that I'm not trying to push the idea that the Seth Material is true or valid (that's a judgement that the article can't make).  For example, the first use of the word """"channeled"""" had quotes around it.  I was the one who put those quotes in, though someone else removed them.  I inserted the first instance of the word """"purportedly"""" (even though it is on the list of words to avoid) because I felt it was needed, and I have reinstated it when other editors removed it.  Someone named """"Itsmejudith"""" has just changed the word """"awareness"""" to """"the idea"""", and I support that change.  I'm mentioning these small things simply as examples to show people that the neutrality of the article is important to me.  And despite what you may have thought (speaking to Verbal now), when I substituted """"Jane Roberts, speaking as Seth, said"""" for """"the Seth personality said"""", I believed that I was making a change that was a leap forward in neutrality (since Roberts was the one who actually uttered the words).

Verbal, I would like to try to bury the hatchet and work together on this article.  Your interest in the article appears to me to be negative, but I am willing to consider the possibility that I am wrong and to see your point of view.  In order to work together, we'll have to discuss specifics of the article on this page.  We'll need to discuss individual passages as well as the broader issues of the article's size and the proportion of primary to secondary cites.

 OneGuy's vanadalism of the discussion page 
Aside from OneGuy deleting other user's comments, he has now begun to blatently disorganize and effectively vanadalize people's comments: he distrupting the flow of users' comments by arbitrarily cutting off paragraphs and inserting his comments in between, instead of being civil and adding his reply to the end of a given post. Combined with his ceasless personal attacks, false accusations, and insistance on making wikipedia a propoganda machine for Islamist apologetics of the blackest kind, his behaviour has become completely intolerable, and I do not see any point in constantly refuting the same false accusations and false assertions over and over again. OneGuy must be ejected from this discussion before it can have any hope of being a civiled and productive debate. I am left with no choice but to completely resign from this discussion, since it seems that no one is going to be moderating OneGuy's behaviour anytime soon.  Pename

What's ironic is that OneGuy claims he is not a muslim and therefore can not be considered an Islamic apologist!  In fact, most of the Muhammad/Islam apologists here claim to not be Muslim!  Looks like Muhammad's best friends are the infidels.  

As of moderating OneGuy's behavior, the Arbitrators are looking into him and myself after he filed a hypocritical arbitration request against me and I thus filed a countercomplaint against OneGuy.  Whenever OneGuy spots someone who doesn't agree with his radical apologistic viewpoint he tries to silence them by any means at his disposal.  OneGuy, in his complaint in arbitration, accused me of rivert(sic) wars and having POV in my contributions yet he does the exact same thing, only more so.  In the arbitration complaint, the arbitrators don't seem as concerned about the POV contributions as they do about personal attacks, revert wars and my vandalism of his user page. See Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/168.209.97.34.  When OneGuy was giving evidence against me he incorrectly called a few minor word changes as a revert war (even though the change were only made once or twice) and he clearly left out the revert wars in which he was involved (but the arbitrators were not fooled - they found him out).

Since the arbitrators will probably not do anything about his radical apologistic contributions, they will most likely respond to his vandalism of the talk pages.  Feel free to post your complaints regarding OneGuy on Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/168.209.97.34/Evidence.    06:56, 9 Dec 2004 (UTC)

 Since when replying on talk page has become vandalism? Only one time I deleted Pename comments when he cut and pasted his comments that were already on the page on top of my response in a new section that I created (""""death to critics""""). Pename has ignored what we are discussing and is resorting to personal insults and false accusations (in violation of wiki policy) that I vandalized the talk page. He now claims that he did not copy the verse from anti-Islamic site. If true, where did he find the interpretation that 8:67 means kill prisoners of war? He implied that interpretation in the article. At worst, the verse condemns the behavior of taking prisoners in order to make money, but he has not given his source that says 8:67 means kill prisoners. Instead of answering where he found that interpretation (if not anti-Islamic site), Pename is resorting to personal insults and outright lies that I vandalized the talk page  18:46, 6 Dec 2004 (UTC)

 An except of analysis from the """"supposed"""" unreliable source 

www.zimbeckchess.com
IT IS A RELIABLE SOURCE. Here is the analysis which I was simply trying to source from the page itself. Some of this is already in UON could I source that instead for the EXACT SAME CHANGE? My site, which is my lifes work as a master was deemed unreliable by non-chess players. Here is the analysis in regards to the pinksi line.
These guys wont understand it because chess is too complicated for them but lets us hope that some other strong player who cares about how low quality wikipedia chess articles are will come by and confirm that my add was reliable instead of these random non-chess players burying it in revisions. This is a public outcry for any sign of intelligent life.

Here is the analysis of the Pinski line which even a beginner should understand. This is FROM THE SITE Zimbeckchess.com which was called unreliable. Will someone please get rid of this dusty Pinksi line already?

Here it is with HOUDINI annotations and evaluations. Or is Houdini not WP:RS?

Thus, the analysis on this page is a lie with one players opinion inserted. 
www.zimbeckchess.com is where this was sourced. It was deemed unreliable because the random guy that edited wanted to war with me because he did not like what I said when I said I felt the Halloween was """"Playable"""". Don't dare play this line anyone! Someone will play this dusty Kaufman line and win a pawn by force!!! Kaufman the all knowing all seeing eye atop the pyramid and Euwe and 100 year old player who would not even be able to beat my laptop in chess. Beware the innocuous PINSKI REFUTATION THAT IS NOT REALLY A REFUTATION

Maybe if I was Carlsen this guy would stop undoing my edits and saying my """"personal website"""" was unreliable. Or maybe not! Maybe Carlsen can not edit Wikipedia. Maybe this is Carlsen in disguise!! Think of how many people RELY on wikipedia. People RELY on experts in their fiedls. But what happens when the experts get ignored?! I guess my master title in chess is toilet paper. So are my chess puzzles. My """"self-published"""" book is probably garbage. Maybe I should delete my """"personal"""" website because its not Krabbes site which this guy likes better because he likes Krabbe better than Zimbeck. In his eyes, judging Zimbeck by one comment made about the opening being playable. What this guy does not know, is theory changes and thats why they call it theory. OR ELSE WE SHOULD JUST CLOSE THIS PAGE AND ALLOW NOBODY TO EDIT IT BECAUSE IT MUST BE FACT!!! AFTER ALL SOMEONE WHO DOES NOT EVEN KNOW HOW TO PLAY CHESS THINKS A DUSTY PINSKI LINE REFUTES THE ENTIRE OPENING AND IT DOES NOT EVEN ENGAGE IN THE SACRIFICE. IT JUST GIVES THE PIECE BACK LIKE A COWARD AND GETS THE WORLDS MOST BORING POSITIONS THAT ARE ALL 0.00 ACCORDING TO HOUDINI.

Yes and no. Yes because, well, it's a technical decision made by the developers; they change the config files at the direction of their bosses, the userrights change. In theory, it is a decision we could make without consulting the community. In practise - look, I've been an editor for 6+ years now, most of those as just an editor (I've been contracted here for, I think, 9 months and change). I know how silly a decision that'd be, both for practical reasons (people would get totally up in arms about it, and for good reason) and ethical ones (we owe a duty to involve editors in decisionmaking wherever we can, because we're a bottom-up organisation, not a top-down one). So generally speaking, I think editors should be able to disagree and I think editors should at least be asked their opinion before a change is made. That's what I believe, and that's why I held that RfC.
That's also why arguing with me is likely to be futile ). Not because this is a WMF decision, not because this is my staff account, but because we asked people what they want and they said """"give this to rollbackers too"""". I believe this was a perfectly valid expression of the community's opinion on the subject, and that it's much more applicable than the 2008 RfC, which was held when the community was in a much different state, addressing an (in some respects) radically different question, and not explicitly prohibiting these actions. So I'm not going to be persuaded by appeals to that, and it's not me you should be looking to persuade - if you want the situation to change, as said, hold your own. If you don't want to do that, I'm stuck in a situation, hired as a person to ensure the community was listened to, where the only way out is to ignore the opinions of those editors who spoke up when presented with the opportunity. And I'm not going to do that.   13:59""",0
