ARE YOU FUCKING RETARDED?

Please do not delete content from articles on Wikipedia, as you did to Solaris (2002 film). Your edits appear to be vandalism and have been reverted. If you would like to experiment, please use Wikipedia:Sandbox for test edits. Thank you. Ali 

What the fuck is your problem. Did you even read what I deleted?

DO you know what the word PLOT means?

Plot does NOT mean talking about the movie's trailer or what genre the movie it is. A plot is a SUMMARY of the movie.

Read what's in the Plot section of """"solaris"""" right now you fucking retard and tell me if it really belongs under the section plot... or any other section. It looks more like trivial facts which are unsupported and should be DELETED as per wiki regulations.
 

Here's an example, dumb fuck, from the solaris wiki page:

""""The film essentially ignores the planet which only serves as an anonymous backdrop, in contrast to Lem's novel which discusses at length the mysterious phenomena on its surface and the futile human attempts to understand them.""""

That is NOT neutrality and has NOTHING to do with the plot.

"Yes, there should be criticism of Schengen.  For Americans and Canadians who want to come and teach English in Schengen countries, the Schengen Agreement is a disaster.  Where before Schengen you could renew your visitor visa by simply leaving and re-entering the country you were teaching in, now you must apply for a work permit, which is a costly and difficult process for Americans and Canadians.  Now, because of Schengen, Americans and Canadians are no longer welcome in Europe to teach English. I have heard of many well intentioned ESL teachers who were travelling between, say Germany and Czech Republic and did not have the proper 'poste Schengen' visa documentation: they were arrested by the police and forcibly stuck on a plane back to America.  No sympathy for their situation, no regard for all their belongings in their flat in Prague, no concern whatsoever: they were treated like criminals breaking the law.  This is the ugly side of Schengen: it is used to keep North Americans from teaching English Europe.  The good old days are gone, replaced with aggressive border police who are looking for ESL teachers to arrest and deport.  Many English schools in Prague, for example, are complaining bitterly against Schengen, because the companies they teach English at want Americannot BritishEnglish teachers.  Further: if you are staying over 30 days on vacation in Europe you will be treated like a criminal because of Schengen: you only get 30 days to visit Europe...then you must GET OUT: or, you must get a travel visa for every single European country you are visiting.  So, for Europeans Schengen may be nice, but for foreigners it is HORRIBLE.  I hate Schengen, and I hate the EU government in Brussels.  What a bunch of fucking assholes!!!

    obsolete English handicap, a game in which forfeit money was held in a cap, from hand in cap"""", which obviously has nothing at all to do with being """"Handy with a cap"""" or even related to the disabled.

Invitation and Recommendations for writing articles on Hindi Wikipedia

Hindi wikipedia invites and welcomes Wikipedians to contribute for the cause of spreading knowledge and the Hindi language. This page contains guidelines for writing a wiki-article on any topic at the Hindi Wikipedia, with special recommendations for writing in Hindi (Note: The script/font-family for Hindi is Devanāgari; the script/font-system for English is Roman script, also, the Hindi spelling system is not completely standardized). This article is yet in English language (mostly), in order to encourage even non-native/foreign people who have learnt/are learning Hindi to contribute to the Hindi wikipedia, and native Hindi speakers who normally write in English. The examples given below are only for explanation.

Recommendations:
Firstly for proper viewing, it is recommended to keep all links NOT-UNDERLINED. Otherwise the मात्रा below the Hindi alphabets might get partly hidden behind the underlines. For this, please go to My Preferences (मेरी पसंद) at the top of the page, then click Misc., and then choose """"underline links -> Never"""". Save your settings. Also, do not click yes for """"justify paragraphs"""", otherwise on some browsers, the devanagari script will appear highly distorted.
All users are requested and encouraged to contribute articles here, especially, to create new articles on general topics. They are also encouraged to expand the existing articles, and improve upon them. A non-user can also do the same; it is recommended but not required to register yourself as a wikipedian user at the Hindi wikipedia. As far as possible, each article should be written with a Neutral Point of View (NPOV)—no nationalistic or partiality or hatred based articles are welcome. The articles should be based on facts—and appropriate references should be provided as and where needed. See the English wiki's help page for editing in general. Almost all the general wiki-features are available for editing on Hindi wiki too. Guidelines for the content matter is mostly the same as given in English wiki.
Since the Hindi wiki is at its initial stages, users are welcome to take introduction and basic points from the English (or another) wikipedia's corresponding article and translate them for small articles. An in-page link to the English wiki's article will be deemed sufficient for references (a template might be created stating this). For longer articles, it is recommended to mention the references separately. 
Since most computer users in India and elsewhere have the standard Western-type keyboard, it is best recommended (but not necessarily required) to use the virtual (software) keyboard like the one of Hindimozhi or of ISIS (Tavultesoft Keyman)—which are freewares. These are advantageous because the contemporary Hindi-speakers in India often write messages/chat using Hindi words but written in Roman (English) script, and the layout of these keyboards is quite the same that such people use. For example, using the """"normal"""" keyboard with this software, typing ga would give ग and ghaa would give घा.
Create the article with its name written in Hindi (devanagari script). Always take care to include the nukta (dot below) for foreign / Urdu loanwords wherever it occurs in the standard spelling. For non-Indian names, use that spelling (for article name and other words) which is commonly encountered in Hindi newspapers, G.K.-books, Hindi-dubbed TV documentaries and Hollywood films and magazines. e.g., America-अमरीका (या अमेरिका), China-चीन, French-फ़्रांसिसी. For English acronyms/short-forms, use the initials in Roman script, and again create a full form in Hindi and redirect it to the short form. e.g. IPA (अन्तर्राष्ट्रीय ध्वनि वर्णाक्षर); UNO (संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघ). Doing the opposite is also fine. But creating the article with the Hindi short form, as सं०रा०सं०, is not recommended. Also, the article proper must be written with the proper nukta, as फ़ारसी, and then, a non-nukta (mis-)spelt version फारसी should preferably be created to redirect to the correct spelling.
Hindi wikipedia strongly recommends the users to write articles in everyday common Hindi in the खड़ीबोली dialect (Hindustani or Hindi-Urdu, i.e., बोलचाल वाली हिन्दी, which may include many loanwords from Persian and Arabic). The use of शुद्ध संस्कृतनिष्ठ हिन्दी  is in general neither required nor recommended. E.g., use: वजह instead of कारण, ख़ास instead of विशेष, वगैरह instead of इत्यादि, लेकिन instead of परन्तु etc. However, for technical and specialized vocabulary, the use of शुद्ध संस्कृतनिष्ठ हिन्दी  is recommended and usually",0

A lot of people in the image gallery are represented as Tajiks while this is not true. Ferodwsi was born in Iran, therefore he could not have been Tajik.

 Bloc voting 

Countries with large populations of non-nationals may have their televote influenced considerably. This has been cited as the reason for apparent bloc voting in the Balkan countries of the former Yugoslavia.[91] 

This is full-blown crazy. What does """"non-nationals"""" mean? These countries have similar cultures and speak the same languages. The stars in Croatia are popular in Serbia and vice versa. People are nationals of their countries in the largest proportion in each of those countries (there are some refugees in each of those countries, but that doesn't really explain why Croatia would always give the highest no. .of pts to Serbia, or Macedonia to Serbia, where there was no conflict to speak of). For example, I'm a Bosnian Serb and me voting for a Croatian or a Serbian song is not unusual. But I'm not a Bosnian non-national. I have the passport of BiH, and my family has never lived in Serbia in history. It's really about mutual intelligibility  which is why Scandinavian bloc votes for each other all the time.

 Wikipedia:BRD 

In your future dealings with editors on articles please be aware of the above policy that says you should discuss any changes after your bold change has been reverted on the article talk page. In other words: 
 You being bold. (which is great).
 Me Reverting because unless they are resurrected by magic zombies are not paranormal creatures in the traditional sense. 
 You should of Discussed.

Please bear this in mind in future. This is so that you can fully justify your reasoning behind the changes, and are not caught up in pointless edit wars going back and forth and then you yourself cannot be accused of edit warring. Look forward to working with you.   ✉  

 I have read other rules where they say if it is done multiple times, then be discussed. And I have seen several main editors, who I'm sure you would know if named, who dodn't follow BRD at all.
 And I wasn't going to discuss my edit on Warm Bodies the second time round because I put it back with sources I found for it. If you weren't happy with that, then I would have discussed it.
 But as you seem happy with it now, as you haven't reverted it, then there isn't any problem.   

Just because they don't, doesn't mean you shouldn't. Old saying, """"do as I say not as I do"""" comes to mind. In other words, do as Wikipedia says, not as other editors do, and you can't really go wrong. 
It's not a case of being happy with it, I just don't want to edit war over it. I do not believe that it is classed as """"paranormal"""" the lead needs sorting anyway as there are far too many genre's listed in the opening lead.   ✉  

 The idea of free will also comes to mind. Like I said, if it was reverted a second time I would have said why it should have been included on the talk page. I'm not going to waste my time. I added an edit in and then later found a source for it. Paranormal romance is currently the only genre there with a source. As we are using our own opinions on the page, you don't believe paranormal romance should be included as there are too many genres, l well I personally think """"fantasy"""" could go. The story is focusing more on paranormal romance than it is on the fantasy, it is inspired by the love story Romeo and Juliet.   
Good idea. I'll get rid of it. A source isn't usually needed for every genre. I will also transfer a copy of this conversation to the article talk page. Just so other involved can par take.   ✉  
 Woops, just realised I moved this over to my archive. Meant to only move the two dormant posts.   
That's cool. I thought it was something like that so I replaced it.   ✉

I've consistently indicated my desire to discuss the content and have somebody else edit the page, but nobody wants to edit the page anymore because every single minor edit gets stomped without discussion, and then we have to endure your complaints and we can't fail to notice your complete lack of content discussion.

So Flewis i am hear to help. Who am i you ask, i am just another one of God's children.

Now let us start by helping you out with a getting a girlfreind. You try too hard and crack lame jokes. Just be nice, be yourself and leve out all the weird antics.",0
""":: One thing that I think is relevant to mention is that the article dedicated towards """"third gender"""" is being debated at this time. The issue surrounds whether it is deserving of it's own article or if it would better fit into the category of gender. I think that after reading the existing entry on gender and debates regarding cultural approaches to the issue that the combination of gender and third gender would remedy two issues and make for a much more comprehensive article regarding the subject of gender as a whole.

"loosely speaking the probability of an event is the number of positive outcomes divided by the number of all possible outcomes. Throw a dice: probability of getting a 3 is 1/6. But now consider something where you have an infinite number of possible outcomes: pick a random number between 3 and 4, the probability of getting exactly pi is 1/infinity = 0. However it is not *impossible* to get pi, just very very unlikely. Of course this is very much a theoretical concept, since in pretty much all real world applications you have only a finite number of possible outcomes.",0

Indeed. I have no problem with using the label in the text if its attributed. Being familiar with LABEL I thought it might make more grammatical sense to include it in the second sentence (after all, this person is a writer first and holocaust denier second: it is through his writing that he does the vast majority of his holocaust denying).

, thank you for the lesson about how people can say and act differently. The gap between your alleged """"mentoring"""" and the insulting comment like """"mother"""" is striking enough. Since you mentioned about Tanthalas, if you prefer his way, well I'd be very careful. On contrary to your analysis, I believe in Wikipedia's virtue, and trust many good users and admins. However, so we can happily agree that adminship is based on the community """"trust"""". I wish you get over your RfA soon. 

However, compared with Tenmei and Bugs' nasty bashing, I got realized  is a gentleman even though he said nothing good about me. However, his comment is understandable because I did not assume good faith on him in the last occasion. I may apologize to him for that matter. 

George, sorry for the trouble. I think this brief reply to them is necessary for courtesy. I will follow your advice and warning onwards. Caspian blue

"""==Notability of Swampfest==
 A tag has been placed on Swampfest requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a real person, organization (band, club, company, etc.), or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.  T/C """,0
Let me spell it out for you. The content of the page you are using as an excuse to put up the speedy deletion tag is a quote from a blog that belongs to me. I am the owner of the blog. What evidence do you need exactly? You have also accused me of originating the article here when the author is someone else and two other people have been accused of sock-puppetry on no evidence. The instructions for the tag say that someone who has originated the article may remove it. That is what I did because I am not the article's originator,0
"Linguistics 

Don't worry I come in peace D
I just saw your discussion with INkubusse about our special letter Ѓ. You said it sounded kind of like a D. That may be because your Macedonian colleagues are from Prilep. In their accent/dialect, Gj (Ѓ) and Kj (Ќ) are pronounced Đ or Dj (Ђ) and Ć or Cj (Ћ) respectively. It is kind of like in Serbian - almost a Џ(Дж) or Ч but palatalized. However, I don't know why this happens in Prilep but not Skopje. It may have something to do with Krale Marko/Kraljević Marko, whose capital was Prilep. The Ќ is the same: we say ноќе, you say нокье (at least that's what I got from Makedonsko Devojče).

Also, what do you think of an article dealing with differences between Macedonian and Bulgarian? There is one for Differences between standard Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian and Macedonian and Bulgarian have more differences than them.",0
